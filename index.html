      <h1>introduction</h1>
      <p>According to Miitomo (which seems to know me scary well), I'm an "easygoing dreamer" aka INFP. I'm open-minded, empathetic, a Hufflepuff with a streak of Gryffindor. <br><br>Introverted I am, and somewhat shy, but once I'm comfortable around you, you've got a loyal friend for life. I can be that friend who has too many plaid shirts and feels zero shame about it. ;D (I need to get emoji support on this site or add them as images because EMOJIS. ARE. EVERYTHING.)</p>

      <h3>Nashville, TN</h3>
      <p>I've got a southern accent to show for it, but that's about it. (Unless you also count a love for fried chicken and sweet iced tea with plenty of lemon taste to it!)</p>
      <p>Note: technically I live in a suburb of Nashville called Hendersonville. But it's just easier to say Nashville to people. :^)    </p>

      <h1>more tidbits</h1>
        <h4>what's important to you?</h4>
          <p>Beyond the typical family and friends answer: intersectional feminism, continual learning, various forms of art like writing, music, animation, painting, science ("art is science, science is art" - <i>Life is Strange</i>). Self-expression & discovery / study of the world around us, basically.</p>
        <h4>what are your favorite hobbies?</h4>
          <p>Playing video games, writing, painting, skateboarding. I'd love to learn how to crochet / knit little animals, too.</p>
        <h4>what's your dream job?</h4>
          <p>Front-end developer / UX design + web design. It'd be awesome to get well rounded in both areas. (As a kid, though, my dream job was to be an author or vet. I'd still love to write and publish a book someday.)</p>
        <h4>what music have you been listening to lately?</h4>
